# book-search

## Description 

The purpose of this project was to create a book search app that would use GraphQL with Apollo Server. While given existing code, I wanted to change that from the restful API functionality that was given to using GraphQL. I built this app using the MERN stack, which includes React, MondgoDB, Node, and Express. In order to do this, I built GraphQL-condusive schemas and made sure they were compatible with the front end. What I mostly learned was more about React and how GraphQL works. 

## Technology Used:

1. Javascript
2. GraphQL
3. React
4. Express
5. Node
6. MongoDB
